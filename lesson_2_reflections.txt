What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    When a repository is git initialized, the meta files are created. After initialization, the files in the repository are tracked.
    Initialization is the method to tell Git to start tracking the files in the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    It will make it easier to commit together the files changed for a logical change (like a bug fix). It also gives an opportunity to review before making the commit.
